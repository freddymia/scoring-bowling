# scoring-bowling

The program should run from the command-line and take a text file as input

The program should read the input text file and parse its content, which should have the results for several players bowling 10 frames each, written according to these guidelines:

- a. Each line represents a player and a chance with the subsequent number of pins knocked down.
- b. An 'F' indicates a foul on that chance and no pins knocked down (identical for scoring to a roll of 0).
- c. The rows are tab-separated.
